# md-report

## What's `md-report`

The repo name `md-report` stands for both "Write your reports in markdown, and get them in docx." and "Made report again." ("马德，又是报告" in Chinese) meanings.

## Motivation

Anyway, it is quite inconvenient for Mac OS / Linux users to deal with MS Office files (sometimes it's the same for Windows users because of the outdated doc template).

Writing characters, words and sentences is easy, but it is difficult to handle style in WPS Office as well as MS Office.

## Benifit

The md-report helps you focus on the content rather than the style of your reports.

## Usage



## Acknowledgement

The idea comes from [slidev](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev), a PowerPoint generator with markdown files.
